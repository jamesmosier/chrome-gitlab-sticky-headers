##About

Forked from [chrome-github-sticky-headers](https://github.com/danybony/chrome-github-sticky-headers), this implementation can be used on gitlab.com. Currently this is not in the Chrome extensions store.

##Development

You need to have NodeJS with `grunt-cli` installed.

```shell
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
$ npm install
```

To debug the application with a live reload mechanism, run:

```shell
$ grunt debug
```

Then add the `app` folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome.
